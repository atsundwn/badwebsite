			<p>
				Hi, I am Minsup!  I was born in S. Korea and I am 33 years old.  I am learning how to code to become a web developer.  I recently graduated from college with a degree in Biology, but I found that I am more interested in computers and technology.  I am excited about learning more about programming.
